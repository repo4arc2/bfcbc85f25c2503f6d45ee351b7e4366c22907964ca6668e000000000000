就这样不停地观察可疑的情况 
You're just constantly looking for things that are suspicious or weird?

100
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,450
这也太没创意了吧
That's a little on the nose.

是他们杀害了我妈妈未婚夫的叔叔吗

不管了 以后再说
Leave it. We'll come back for it.

141
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,160
要干什么 把我们都害死 
...tryin' to do, kill us all?

142
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,450
你们把整个街区都烧了
You're burning down the whole freaking neighborhood.

143
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,660
-你说什么  -有点…
-What? -It's a little...

144
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,870
-我听不清 -很严重 都烧起来了
-I can't hear you. -It's a lot. Everything.

145
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,790
你刚才着火了
You were on fire.

146
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,080
-我没事 -你刚才着火了
-I'm okay. -You were on fire.

147
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,580
-你就像个烤串一样 -不
-Like a little shish kebab. -No.

148
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,450
那么 咱们去哪 
So where are we going?

149
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,410
躲开那些想杀了你的人
Getting further away from those people trying to kill you.

150
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,040
好 然后呢 
Right. And after that?

151
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,500
咱们需要补给
We'll need some supplies.

152
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,660
太棒了 复仇者的补给吗 
Hell yeah. Avenger supplies?

153
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,080
抗生素软膏

154
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,750
伤口愈合
Not gonna lie to you.

155
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,080
我有话直说 这可有点泄气
This is a bit of a letdown.

156
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,580
抱歉让你失望了
Sorry to disappoint you.

157
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,370
能帮我拿点按摩酒精吗  在那边下面的货架
Wanna grab some of that rubbing alcohol over there? Lower shelf.

158
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,790
咱们现在有什么计划 
So what's the plan now?

159
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,160
让我猜一下 咱们要去你的安全屋 
Let me guess. We're going to your safe house?

160
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,660
是在复仇者大厦里吗 
Is it in Avengers Tower?

161
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,080
不是 托尼几年前把大厦卖了
No. Tony sold that. A few years ago.

162
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,750
这可真是令人惋惜
That is so sad on so many levels.

163
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,790
来吧
-Come on.  -

164
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,620
-能帮我再拿两个那个吗  -好
-Can I get a couple of those two? -Yeah.

165
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,080
-这两个  -对
-These two right here? -Yeah.

166
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,200
-你想要蓝的还是红的  -红的
You want the blue or the red? Uh, red.

167
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,290
好吧 怎么着 你想怎么样 
All right. What is it? What do you want with me?

168
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,620
我得找个地方让你藏起来 保证安全
Look, I gotta find a place to stash you. Safe.

169
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,290
然后我去把衣服拿回来 再把你这烂摊子收拾好
So I can recover the suit and clean your mess.

170
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,080
把我藏起来 我又不是一袋子钱
Stash me? I'm not a bag of money.

171
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,870
你当然不是 一袋子钱还更有用呢
No, you're not. A bag of money'd be useful to me.

172
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,830
下一位
Next.

173
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,700

Hi, how are you? Merry Christmas.

174
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,000
其实我知道一个地方 在十个街区以外
I actually do know a place about 10 blocks away.

175
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,000
一袋子钱能知道地方吗 
Would a bag of money know a place?

176
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,950
好吧
Okay.

177
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,540

182
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,000
好吧 这地方虽然没那么安全 但是还凑合吧
Okay, not exactly a fortress, but it'll do, right?

183
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,120
这是我姑妈的家 她去佛罗里达过冬了
It's my aunt's place. She's in Florida for the winter.

184
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,160
帮我拿一下
Hold that for me.

185
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,040
好吧
Right.

186
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,540
家里有猫吗 
- Is there cats in here? -Mm.

187
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,000
只有猫毛
-Just cat hair. -

188
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,040
好吧
Okay.

189
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,160

Here. I need you to clean your wounds. Use this. Use soap, this and disinfect it.

190
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,040
我回你公寓去拿衣服
All right. I'm going back to your apartment to get that suit.

191
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,700
然后我就回我孩子那里了
And then I'm going back to my kids.

192
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,830
好的 克林特 你可以去我的公寓
Oh, yes, Clint, you may enter my apartment.

193
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,910
你不需要用我的钥匙吗 
Don't you need my keys?

194
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,450
不需要 我能搞定 待在这 把门锁好
Nope. I'm good. Stay here. Lock this door.

195
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,250
队长让所有人退后
Yeah, Captain wants to keep everybody back.

196
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,500
听着还行
WOAll right, sounds good.

197
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,120
正在关店 他们朝那边去了…
...closing up the shop. They headed down...

198
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,830
把那面墙打破 好吗 
Go ahead and break up that wall, all right?

199
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,370
纽约市消防局

200
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,750

201
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,000
我下来了
Coming down.

202
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,160

Where is it?

204
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,250
纽约市 真人角色扮演

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,080

206
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,500

Nothing. I went out the back.

207
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,080
-你好 -你好
-Hey. -Hey.

208
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,250

That was crazy.

209
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,200

-I gotta go. Love you. -I love you, too.

212
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,660
从什么时候开始 人们把〝我爱你〟挂在嘴边上了 
When did everybody start saying, "I love you," to everybody all the time?

213
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,750
那是我妈妈
That was my mom.

214
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,000
从什么时候开始 你变得这么斤斤计较了
Since when did your heart shrink three sizes?

215
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,950
从一个小女孩穿着忍者服 偷走了我的圣诞节开始
When a little girl in a ninja costume stole my Christmas.

216
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,370
怎么了 
What?

217
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,000
我这是一举两得
-Multitasking. -Hmm.

218
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,120
一边消肿
Reducing swelling.

219
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,750
一边给披萨狗准备早饭
Thawing out Pizza Dog's breakfast.

220
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,290
狗叫这个名字 
Is that the, uh, dog's name?

221
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,250
它没有名字
He doesn't have a name.

222
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,000
更像是它的头衔
It's more of a title of nobility.

223
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,750
比如〝三明治伯爵〟
Like Earl of Sandwich.

224
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,200
你的伤口怎么样 
How's your wound?

225
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,790
没事 还有点疼
Uh, all right. It still hurts a little bit.

227
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,330
-怎么了  -你清洗伤口了吗 
-What? -Did you clean it?

228
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,250
洗了
-Yeah. -You did it all wrong.

229
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,450
你没弄好 我来帮你 好吗 
Let me fix it. Okay?

230
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,950
-你要把它撕下来  -对
-You're taking it off? -Yeah.

231
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,330
你贴错了
It's on wrong.

232
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,410
我要像撕创可贴一样撕下来 好吗  准备好 一
And I'm just gonna rip it off like a Band-Aid. Okay? -Ready. One. Oh. Oh. -

233
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,080
好了 得先清洗干净
All right. Just gonna clean it up.

234
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,830
万一要是感染了 你这星期就得遭罪了
You don't want this infected, it'll ruin your week.

235
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,830
-其实也没那么严重 -好吧
-Ooh. That's actually not so bad. -Okay.

236
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,660
就是个擦伤 你得垂直贴
It's a deep scratch. Want these perpendicular to it,

237
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,080
伤口得闭合起来 这样才能固定住
you wanna close it. This is helping it cinch.

238
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,160
才能快速愈合 搞定了
So it can mend to each other faster.

239
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,410
-好 -没事了 
-Yeah. Mm-hmm. -All good?

240
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,200
我家怎么样了 
So, how's my place?

241
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,370
烧没了
Crispy.

242

没有
No.

244
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,910
但是你有线索了
But you have a lead.

245
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,660
你怎么知道 
What makes you say that?

246
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,330
这是什么 
What is this?

247
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,870
我要把我记忆中
Oh, I started to describe, um,

248
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,410
穿运动服的长相记下来
what I could remember of the Tracksuits' faces.

249

圆脸 皮肤很白

250
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,160
看来你没什么艺术细胞
I guess you're not an art major.

251
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,250
好吧

Um, I would offer to buy you a hotel, uh, 'cause from certain angles,

253

这都是我惹的麻烦
I know this all looks like my fault.

254
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,080
但是我妈把我的信用卡取消了 因为那个钟楼的事
Um, but my mom cancelled my credit cards due to the whole clock tower.

255
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,620
我不需要
That's not necessary.

256
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,700
我等会就走了 孩子

Thank you. This is a car to the airport.

279
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,750
到了机场以后 都听库珀的
Once you get to the airport, Cooper's in charge.

280
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,330
不许买甜甜圈
No donuts, buddy.

281
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,200
什么 为什么要听他的  他就是个笨蛋
What? Why's he in charge? He's an idiot.

282
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,910
我岁数最大
But I got seniority.

283
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
到了以后 妈妈会在那边接你们 好吗 
When you land, your mom is gonna be waiting there, okay?

284
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,500
是那个忍者的事吗 
Is this about the ninja?

285
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,870
不是 和忍者没关系
No, it's not about the ninja.

286
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,950
最重要的是 记住 〝别把内特弄丢了〟 好吗 
Most importantly, remember these words, "Don't lose Nate." Okay?

287
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,120
内特去哪了 
Where is Nate?

288
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,370
内特去哪了 
Where is Nate?

289
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,910
孩子们 上车吧
Guys, get in the car, please.

290
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,870
内特 快点过来
Nate, come on, buddy.

291
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,450
好了 来吧
Okay. Come on.

292
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,500
来吧 孩子 你吃什么了这么沉 
Come on, buddy. What did you eat?

293
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,950
准备好了吗 
You ready?

294
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,000
好了 孩子
Okay, buddy.

295
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,000
我爱你 爸爸
I love you, Dad.

296
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,830
我更爱你
I love you more.

297
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,950
上车吧 快点 莱拉 走了
Now get inside, buddy. Come on, Lila, let's go.

298
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,160
这是什么表情 
Huh? What's with this face?

299
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,540
你的额头上有道伤 爸爸
You have a cut on your forehead, Dad.

300
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,750
发生什么了 是不是出事了 
What's going on? Should we be worried?

301
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:29,660
没事 这对我来说是家常便饭 不是什么大事 好吗 去吧
No, no. It's nothing. Daddy's got this. It's no big deal. Okay? Come on.

302
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,370
我还真的以为你会回家过圣诞节呢
I really thought you were gonna be home for Christmas.

303
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,950
听我说 我肯定回家过圣诞节
Hey, look at me. I'll be home for Christmas.

304
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,700
-你保证吗  -我保证
-Promise me. Promise? -Yeah, okay.

305
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,410
我刚才说都听库珀的
I said Coop's in charge,

306
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,000
他不行 还是听你的
he's not. You're in charge.

307
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,410
你一直都是最懂事的 照顾好他们
You always have been. Look after these boys.

308
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,910
圣诞快乐 回头见
Merry Christmas. See you soon.

309
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,410
-说话算话 好吗  -我保证
-Keep your word, okay? -I will. I promise.

310
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,410
你们注意安全 好吗  到家给我打电话 我爱你们
-You guys be safe, okay? -Okay. Call me when you get home? I love you.

311
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,660
再见 爸爸
Bye, Dad.

312
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,660
再见 爸爸 别担心 我能搞定
Bye, Dad. Don't worry. I got this.

313
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,580
-库珀 你才搞不定呢 -爱你
Cooper, you do not got this. Love you!

314
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,870
纽约市警察局正在调查一宗重案
A major NYPD investigation is underway.

315
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,040
纽约市的名流阿曼德·杜凯恩 昨晚在他的住所被发现遇害
New York socialite Armand Ducane was found dead in his home last night.

316
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,950
目击者称见到一神秘人物逃离现场
Witnesses saw a mysterious figure leaving the scene.

317
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,450
但是…
But that's...

318
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,000
-对 -人物描述吻合
-Yeah. -The description matches

319
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,950
昨晚拍卖会抢劫案中的蒙面刺客
the masked assailant from last night's auction robbery.

320
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,080
这两起事件让警方怀疑
These two events have officials wondering

321
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,700
浪人是否真的回到了纽约
if indeed, the Ronin has returned to New York City,

322
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,370
他是否杀害了阿曼德·杜凯恩
if he may be responsible for Armand Ducane's death,

323
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,330
以及他接下来有何企图
and what he may do next.

324
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,040
天啊 等等 他们以为我是那个
Wait. Wait, they think I... Oh, my God.They think I'm that...

325
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,910
-蒙面刺客  -这才不到24小时
vigilante? It's been less than 24 hours,

326
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,450
你就已经上两次新闻了 真厉害
you've been on the news twice. Impressive.

327
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,410
我跟你说过那件衣服会惹麻烦
Told you that suit was bad news.

328
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,700
克林特 我得走了
Clint, I gotta go.

329
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,370
不行 你现在绝对不能走
Uh, no, no, no. That is, uh, the last thing you need to do, actually.

330
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,250
别忘了那些运动服的家伙 昨天两次想要你的命
Let's not forget the Tracksuit guys trying to kill you twice yesterday.

331
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,580
我得去找到那件衣服 在此之前 你哪也不能去
I'm going to find this suit, and until I do, you're gonna stay put.

332
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,620
外面显然不安全
It's not safe, obviously.

333
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,950
我不去上班才不安全
Not showing up at work is not safe.

334
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,660
我妈已经很焦虑了
My mom is already high strung.

335
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,580
不过她居然没打电话找我
Surprised she hasn't called me already.

336
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,500
哪也别去 拜托
Just stay put, please.

337
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,580
就算我在这待着 她也一样会来找我
Look, if I stay put, she's just gonna come and find me, anyway.

338
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,120
她是开安保公司的 那肯定是我能去的最安全的地方了
She owns a security company. It's literally the safest place I can go.

339
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,120
不行 反正你不听我的 是不是 
Yeah, no. You're just not gonna listen to me, are you?

340
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,700
我想听 但是我也没办法
I want to, but no.

341
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,410
去换衣服吧
Go get changed.

342
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,870
这打扮太蠢了
You look silly.

343
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,000
好吧 我去看看她有什么衣服
All right, I'll go see what else she has.

344
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,040
我快迟到了 都赖你
I'm gonna be late, thanks to you.

345
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
没有我你早没命了
You're gonna be alive 'cause of me.

346
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,410
老兄 给你
Hey, man, here you go.

347
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,370
好吧
-All right. -Oh.

348
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,290
真是绅士啊 走在外侧 不错
Being a gentleman, walking on the outside. Nice.

349
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,870
不 只有这样我才能听见你说话
No, no, it's just so I can hear you.

350
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,040
我要说清楚 不是我想走这边
And to be clear, not 'cause I want to,

351
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,750
是我必须得走这边
-just 'cause I need to. -Oh.

352
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,870
怎么回事 
What happened?

353
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,950
一言难尽
Uh, too hard to tell.

354
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,290
妈妈 他是超级英雄
Mommy, Mommy, a superhero.

355
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,790
史蒂夫 要去打个招呼吗 
Wow, Stevie, you wanna say hi?

356
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,120
来吧 孩子
Come on, kid!

357
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,580
小旅行家
Puny tourist.

358
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,830
-看 那个是你 -不是
-Hey, look, that one's you. -No.

359
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,250
那是凯特尼斯·伊芙狄恩 走吧
That's Katniss Everdeen. Let's go.

360
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,450
你的问题在于人设
Your problem is branding.

361
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,750
不 我的问题是你
No, my problem is you.

362
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,790
还有这件忍者服
And this ninja suit,

363
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,080
还有那些因为这件衣服 要杀了你的人
and the people trying to kill you 'cause of it.

364
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,580
我今天必须要解决这些问题
It's a problem that I'm going to solve today,

365
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,910
这样我才能回去和家人团聚
so I can go home to my family.

366
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,660
不 就是人设的问题
No, it's branding.

367
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,450
你的问题在于你太低调了 这种人设没什么卖点
Your whole thing is that you're low-key. It's a very hard brand to sell.

368
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,870
我本来也没想卖什么人设
Well, I'm not really trying to sell anything.

369
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,580
这个形象确实让你显得很酷
It should technically make you cooler,

370
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,830
但是自从复仇者联盟出现后 发生了那么多可怕的事
but with the scary stuff that's happened since the Avengers appeared,

371
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,040
人们不喜欢那种愤世嫉俗的冷酷形象了
people don't want that cynical, cool thing anymore.

372
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,620
他们要的是真诚
They want sincerity.

373
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,250
-是吗  -不是一脸苦大仇深
-That right? -Not self-seriousness,

374
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,370
而是那种真情流露
but a heart-on-your-sleeve sincerity.

375
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,330
我知道了
I see.

376
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,750
你太内敛了 你的防备心太强
You are very contained. Keep your cards close to your vest,

377
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,700
就像穿了16层防弹装甲一样
which you wear over a suit of armor and, like, 16 other layers of self-protection.

378
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,910
而你的内心隐藏得太深
All of which, under, finally, is your heart.

379
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,250
让人一点都感受不到
So, not exactly on your sleeve.

380
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,450
再说一遍 我没想卖什么人设
Again, not really trying to sell anything.

381
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,500
好吧 但是你就是这样的
But you do, anyway.

382
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,580
好吧 凯特 那你说我能给人们什么 
Yeah, okay, Kate. Um, what am I selling, then, huh?

383
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,540
肯定不是万圣节服装或架子上的玩具
It's certainly not Halloween costumes or toys off the shelf.

384
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,500
激励 克林特
Inspiration, Clint.

385
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,160
我到办公室了 下班以后咱们在安全屋见 
The office is here. Shall we meet at the safehouse after work?

386
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,080
如果今天的计划顺利
Uh, if all goes as planned today,

387
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,500
这就是咱俩最后一次见面了
this is gonna be the last time we see each other.

388
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:42,000
你才刚教会我怎么甩掉追踪者 这还是我早就知道的
All you've taught me is how to lose a tail and I almost already knew that.

389
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,580
好吧 我还教给你如何包扎伤口了
Right, maybe I taught you how to bandage a wound.

390
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,580
-这得算吧  -那特殊弓箭呢 
-How's that? -But what about trick arrows?

391
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,790
没有什么特殊弓箭 凯特
There are no trick arrows, Kate.

392
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,870
把你的手机号输一下 仅限紧急情况
Here, put your phone number in here. For emergencies only.

393
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,790
进去吧 注意安全
Just go inside. Stay safe.

394
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,450
-我拨一下 这样我就可以… -明白
-Just lettin' it ring, so I have... -Gotcha.

395
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,500
有你的号码
...your number.

396
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,160
仅限紧急情况 否则我就把你拉黑删除了
Emergencies only, or I'll block and delete you.

397
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,040
那就再见了
Um, this is goodbye.

398
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,700
-好吧 -很好 圣诞快乐
-Okay. -Great. Merry Christmas.

399
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,790
-好吧 -就这样 
-All right. -Okay?

400
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,370
好 晚点联系
Cool. Call you later.

401
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,750
不 别联系了
No, please don't.

402
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,870
我有你的号码
I got your number.

403
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,790
这样应该可以 我们可以先加到日程里…
That'll work. We can put it in her calendar for now and...

404
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,160
毕肖普安保公司

405
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,250
我一会就回来
Hey. Back in a sec, D.

406
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,200
-你好 凯特 不行 -早上好
-Oh. Hi, Kate. Nope. Oh. -Good mornin'.

407
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,450
抱歉 我知道 你不用说…
I'm sorry. I know. Before you say it...

408
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,500
凯蒂
Katy.

409
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,370
早上好
Good morning.

410
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,830
是凯特
Kate.

411
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,370
请节哀 我在新闻里看到了
Sorry for your loss. I, um, saw it on the news.

412
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,620
谢谢你 凯特 谢谢你的安慰
Thank you, Kate. That's very sweet of you.

413
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,160
他对我非常重要
He was very dear to me.

414
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,290
肯定很难接受吧
Must've come as quite a shock.

415
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,700
是啊
It did.

416
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,000
确实如此
It did, indeed.

417
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,660
你们俩肯定很亲密
You two were probably really close.

418
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,200
我们的关系很特别
Well, we had a special relationship.

419
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,450
那他的遗产呢 
What about the inheritance?

420
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,330
凯特 你穿的什么衣服 
Kate, what are you wearing?

421
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,950
这是…
Oh, this, it's, um...

422
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,120
朋友的衣服 我借着穿的
A friend's. Just borrowing it.

423
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,160
我怎么听说你的公寓昨天晚上着火了 
What's this I hear about a fire in your apartment last night?

424
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,580
说来话长 咱们能聊聊吗 
I can explain. Can we talk?

425
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,870
没有外人 
Without the interloper?

426
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,870
-拜托 -没事 她对我有敌意
-Please. -No, no, it makes perfect sense

427
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,620
这很正常
that she would be hostile.

428
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,660
她可能觉得我取代了她的位置
She likely feels displaced by me,

429
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,080
她在考验咱们的感情
and she's testing our new dynamic.

430
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,330
她既想得到我的认可 又想划清界限
She both desires my approval, yet wants to set firm boundaries.

431
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,620
她甚至觉得我威胁她的地位了 不过你知道吗 
She feels threatened by me, and you know what?

432
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,120
我完全能理解
I can understand why.

433
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,330
我买了本书 关于如何扮演继父的角色
I bought a book. About being a stepdad.

434
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,910
这钱花得值 杰克
Money well spent, Jack.

435
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,790
凯特
Kate,

436
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,040
今晚杰克下厨 你来一起吃饭吧
Jack's cooking dinner. Why don't you join us?

437
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
好
Fine.

438
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,870
只有一个条件
On one condition.

439
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,830
什么条件 
What's that?

440
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,250
由我来决定晚餐时的话题
I come up with the conversation topics.

441
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,160
纽约市真人角色扮演 和我们一起战斗吧

442
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040

443
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,250
-你好 -你好
-Hi. -Hey.

444
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,700
找到你了
Ah, there you are.

445
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,200
嘿 别在这东张西望
Uh, Hey. There's no looky-loos.

446
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,080
我不是来找麻烦的
Uh, I'm not trying to cause any trouble here.

447
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,500
我就是想找那个忍者聊聊 就那个
I just wanna talk to that ninja, right there?

448
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,410
他偷了那件衣服
Stole that suit.

449
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,910
所以我得找他谈谈
So, I'd like to talk to him.

450
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,370
那就等扮演活动结束后 你再找他吧
So, you can take that up with him when the LARP is over.

451
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,500
真人角色扮演 这个活动
The Live Action Role Play. This, you know... This whole thing.

452
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,200
-等等 什么时候结束 -半夜
-Wait, when is it over? -Midnight.

453
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,290
那可不行 我只需要几分钟…
Yeah, that's not gonna work. It's just gonna take a couple minutes...

454
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,450
嘿
Uh... Hey.

455
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,120
听着 我知道你是谁
Look, I know who you are,

456
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,330
但是这里的大多数人都是消防员和警察
but most of those folks out there are firefighters and cops.

457
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,330
如果你坏了规矩 小心吃不了兜着走
And if you break the rules, it's gonna get real messy.

458
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,500
什么规矩 
What are the rules?

459
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,540

460

That's classified.

-职务 单位  -好吧
-Title? Organization? -All right, yeah.

464
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,040
我就直接签名吧 然后好戏就该上演了
Let me just sign it, and, uh, we'll get this show on the road.

465
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,040
你的卷轴上有你这个角色的任务
So, your scroll details your character's mission.

466
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,120
-好 -新手只能被豁免攻击一次
-Right. -Beginners only get one free hit.

467
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,250
如果被击中躯干 你就死了
If you get hit in the torso, it's fatal.

468
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,040

祝你玩得开心
And have fun.

470
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,790
这是干什么用的 
What do you do with this?

471
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,160
这是你的行为守则
That's what you live by.

472
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,080
-好的 谢谢 -等等 你的装备
-Okay. Thank you. -Wait, wait, wait, your armaments.

473
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,870
头盔
Helmet.

474
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,120
非戴不可吗 
I mean, do I have to?

475
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,750
天啊
Goodness!

476
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,580
我是个维京人 我真的是个维京人
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm a Viking. I'm really a Viking.

477
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,910
随你便
I don't care.

478
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,160
等等 你不是鹰眼吗 
Wait a minute. Aren't you Hawkeye?

479
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,580
我不是来闹事的 好吗 
I'm not trying to cause a scene here, all right?

480
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,580
我尊重
Out of respect

481
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,290
你们这些破玩意 但是我快失去耐心了
to whatever the hell this is, but I'm plumb out of patience.

482
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,950
你有两个选择
You got two choices.

483
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,160
我可以拿这把假剑
I could take this pretend-sword

484
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,120
假装把你砍死 然后我把你的衣服拿走
and you pretend to die and I take that suit,

485
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,870
我也可以真的揍你一顿
or I'm gonna real punch you

486
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,500
你会真的满地找牙 然后我把你的衣服拿走
and you're gonna real fall down and I'm gonna take that suit.

487
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,120
要不让我杀了你吧
Just let me kill you.

488
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,200
然后我把衣服给你
And I'll give you the suit.

489
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,500
-不行 -拜托 老兄
-No. -Come on, man.

490
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,370
你在现实生活里就是超级英雄
You're a superhero in real life.

491
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,080
这可是我离成为超级英雄最近的一次
This is as close as I'm ever gonna get to being one.

492
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,450
配合我一下 让我杀了你
Just work with me. Let me kill you.

493
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,040
我可是和灭霸交过手的人
And I fought Thanos.

494
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,950
-好吧 -太好了
-Okay. -All right, cool.

495
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,500
-快点 -好
-Just make it quick. -Yeah.

496
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,160
什么 不行 你得入戏 咱们得像真的决斗一样
What? No, you gotta make it look real. We gotta have trial by combat.

497
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,540
克林特·巴顿

498
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,000
想我了吗

499
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,120
不要假装和朋友在忙正事

500
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,370
咱们都知道你没什么朋友

501
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,330
来电

502
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,540
好吧 我可能说的有点过分 但是看来还挺有用的
Okay, so, I was kinda mean, but I think it worked.

503
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,700
凯特·毕肖普 
Kate Bishop?

504
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,120
你是哪位 
Uh, depends who's asking.

505
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,700
我是纽约市警察局的卡德尔探员
This is Detective Caudle of the New York Police Department asking.

506
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,830
你有什么事 
Then it depends what you're asking.

507
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,160
你是凯特·毕肖普吗 
I'm asking if this is Kate Bishop.

508
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,290
是的
Yeah, it is.

509
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,290
毕肖普小姐 你能来警局和我们聊一下吗 
Ms. Bishop, can you come down to the station for a quick chat?

510
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,250
我不太清楚你们的规矩
Uh, I'm... I'm sort of unclear what the rules are here.

511
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,330
我能问问有什么事吗 
Am I, um, able to ask what this is regarding?

512
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,620
你知道昨天晚上你的公寓着火了吗 
Are you aware there was a fire in your apartment last night?

Totally, totally.

00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,620
你听起来一点都不难过
-You don't seem too upset about it. -

516
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,500
我没在家 所以谢天谢地 我没事
Well, I wasn't home, so, thankfully, uh, I'm... I'm fine.

517
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,830
你能告诉我昨天晚上你去哪了吗 
Mind telling me where you were last night?

518

Can we just please... Let's get on with this.

527
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,000
这么做可没好处
Uh-oh. You're not gonna reap the benefits.

528
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,910
-他没喝药水  -他在想什么 
-He didn't drink the potion? -WOWhat is he thinking?

529
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,370
衣服归赢家

What you doin'?

让打斗更加真实
I'm trying to sell it. You gotta make it real.

538
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,660
-你得让大家信服 -赶紧杀了我
-They gotta believe it. -Just kill me.

548
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,660
叫我克林特就行了
You can call me Clint.

549
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,080
我能叫你克林特 
I... I can call you Clint?

550
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,410
是啊
Yeah.

551
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,410
-帮我把这个拿到前台去吧 -好
-You could take this to the front desk. -Yeah.

552
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,000
但是他们可不能收我的钱
-Can't have that on my credit card.

553
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,160
-不行 他们要收费的 -好吧
-Nah, they will charge you.Yeah.

554
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,540
不过 说真的 谢谢你 我欠你个人情
No, but, seriously, thank you. I owe you one.

555
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,200
这是我一生中最幸福的一天
This has been, like, the best day of my life.

556
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,580
我可没有同感
I can't say the same.

557
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,370
拜托 你也玩得很开心 是不是 
I mean, come on. You did have fun, right?

558
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,080
挺好玩的
I'm glad I did it.

559
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,080
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

560
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,120
你也是 克林特
You, too, Clint.

561
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,450
-保重 -我叫格瑞尔
-Take care. -Oh! I'm... I'm... I'm Grills.

562
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,290
见到你很高兴 格瑞尔
Nice to meet you, Grills.

563
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,790
-糖霜在哪  -别在我屋里捣乱
Where's the frosting? Don't mess up my house.

564
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,950
亲爱的
Hi, hon.

565
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,580
我赶不上飞机了
I'm not gonna make my flight.

566
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,700
没关系的 有航空险
That's all right. That's what, uh, flight insurance is for.

567
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,750
更衣室

568
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,500
糖霜总是不够用
There's never enough frosting.

569
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,500
很严重吗 
How bad is it?

570
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,250
还需要一天吧
One more day, I think.

571
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,250
那件惹事的衣服怎么样了 
How's the problematic wardrobe?

572
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,080
拿到了
Yeah, safe.

573
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,410
保险起见 我得带着它
I need to hang on it for insurance.

574
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,330
至少等我
At least, until I

575
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,910
解决了那些运动服朋友再说
clear things up with the old Tracksuit friends.

576
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,200
天啊 又是那些白痴
Jesus, not those idiots.

577
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,370
对 那些白痴
Yeah, those idiots.

578
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,620
我不确定会怎么样
I'm not sure how high it goes up,

579
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,830
所以我只能多待一段时间
so I just gotta stick around a bit longer.

580
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,950
我和莱拉保证了回去过圣诞节
I promised... I promised Lila I'd be there for Christmas.

581
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:07,450
那你还有五天时间兑现承诺
Well, then you have five days to keep that promise.

582
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,080
是的
Yeah.

583
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,790
我要错过和大家一起搭建姜饼屋了
I'm missing out on, uh, gingerbread house construction.

584
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:19,540
没事的 反正你也只会帮倒忙 你打算怎么办 
Nah, it's okay. You'd have slowed us down. What's the play?

585
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,870
引蛇出洞
-A little catch release.

586
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,160
很好
-Nice.

587
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,830
娜塔莎的经典招数
One of Nat's old moves.

588
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,830
-小心点 -好的
-Be careful. -Yeah.

589
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,200
给我发点照片 让我看看他们在折腾什么
Send me pictures. I wanna see the disaster.

590
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,540
我该去自投罗网了
Time to get myself caught.

591
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,540
你们快点 赶紧弄完
You guys, come on. We gotta finish!

592
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,160
真好吃 杰克 谢谢你
That was delicious, Jack. Thank you.

593
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,750
你喜欢吃 我很开心
-I'm so glad you liked it. -Mmm.

594
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,830
做好烩饭的秘诀在于
The secret to a good risotto is to

595
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,370
搅拌
agitate it.

596
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,700
就这一点
Just enough.

597
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,660
剩下的就是耐心和专注了
And then it's just down to patience and attention.

598
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:04,080
你又会做饭 又细心 还有钱
You cook, you're attentive, you're wealthy.

599
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
好得都有点不真实了
You're almost too good to be true.

600
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,120
我向你保证 也没那么好
I assure you, I am not.

601
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,910
听说你是个剑迷 杰克 你会击剑吗 
So, it seems you're quite the sword aficionado, Jack. Do you fence?

602
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,910
玩玩还行
I dabble.

603
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,290
那你是玩花剑 佩剑还是重剑 
Would you say you're more an épée, foil, or sabre man?

604
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,750
懂得不少啊 小姑娘
You know your stuff, little lady.

605
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,290
我可拿过两次州冠军
I was a two-time state champion.

606
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,580
我擅长冷兵器格斗
Good with all the outdated weapons.

607
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,750
所以如果有人在背后捅刀子 我能意识到
Made me aware of when someone is trying to stab you in the back.

608
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,160
行了 你们俩都已经证明对剑的了解了
Okay, I think you've both proven that you know what swords are.

609
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,910
-咱们能换个话题吗  -但是亲爱的
-Can we move on now? -Oh, but, dear,

610
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,040
我觉得有共同语言能更好地磨合关系
I think a common interest is very fertile ground for bonding.

611
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,200
我也是这么想的
That's exactly what I was thinking.

612
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,790
磨合
-Bonding. -Mm.

613
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,290
-要不咱们切磋一下  -拜托 别了 好吗 
-Let's break out these bad boys. -Please, let's not, okay?

614
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,080
这礼拜的破事已经够多的了
We've had enough drama this week.

615
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,200
是啊
Yeah.

616
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:09,290
也许你妈妈说得对
You know, perhaps... perhaps your mother is right.

617
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:12,250
来嘛 怕什么 你有多余的击剑装备
Oh, come on, why not? You've got some spare fencing gear.

618
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,790
-我说不过她 -她就说了〝怕什么〟
-I'm convinced. -All she said was, "Why not?"

619
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:20,160
怎么就说不过了 你都没开始说
That's not a convincing argument. That's not an argument at all.

620
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,290
所以呢…
And yet...

621
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,370
我去拿我的装备
I'm gonna go get my stuff.

622
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,580
怎么了 
What?

623
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,790
多好玩啊
This'll be fun.

624
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,790
亲爱的 小心点
Honey, be careful.

625
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,450
我什么时候不小心了 
When am I not careful?

626
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,250
我是对杰克说的
I was talking to Jack.

627
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,830
实力不错啊
Wow. You are good.

628
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,120
别放水 杰克
Don't let me win, Jack.

629
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,040
当然不会 再来 
I wouldn't. Go again?

630
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,330
又打到我了 真厉害
Oh! Caught me again. Wow, you are good.

631
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,250
凯特 我不想让未婚夫变成残废 拜托
Kate, I prefer a fiancé with four limbs, please.

632
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,120
别放水了
Stop letting me win.

633
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,660
我没有 真的
I... I'm not. Honest. I mean,

634
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,580
你可是两次州冠军啊
-two-time state champ, right? -

635
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,580
你在掩饰什么 杰克 
What are you hiding, Jack?

636
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,250
我没掩饰 我一向很坦率
Nothing. I'm an open book.

637
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,950
是不是 亲爱的
Right, darling?

638
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,950
凯特
Kate!

639
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,410
你到底要干吗 
What is wrong with you?

640
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,540
他在说谎
He's lying.

641
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,040
说实话 我确实让着你呢
To be fair, I did downplay my skill

642
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,620
然后撒谎说没有
and repeatedly lie about it.

643
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,910
她想要刺你的脸
She tried to stab you.

644
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,330
不 我知道他能挡开 我是想要
No, I knew he would parry. What I was trying to do was

645
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,830
证明他在说谎 看来我猜得一点没错
prove that he is lying, which I successfully did.

646
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,450
我去换衣服了
I'm gonna go change.

647
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,620
我真没想到你会这样
I cannot believe you.

648
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,410
杰克在掩饰什么 妈妈
Jack is hiding something, Mom.

649
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:44,290
你不觉得有点奇怪吗  他叔叔威胁你
Don't you think it's a little strange that the same night his uncle threatens you,

650
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:47,160
然后当晚就死于剑伤 
-he ends up murdered by sword? -

651
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,500
每年纽约有多少人被剑杀死 
How many people get murdered by sword each year in New York?

652
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,790
我觉得是零
I'm gonna go ahead and guess zero.

653
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,620
凯特 你为我担心我很欣慰
Kate, it's sweet that you're worried,

654
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,790
但是记住 我是你妈妈 保护你是我的责任
but just remember I'm the mom. It's my job to protect you.

655
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:59,200
-我已经不是小孩了 -你也不是什么超级英雄
-I'm not a kid anymore. -You're not a superhero either.

656
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:04,830
好吗 发生在阿曼德身上的事很可怕 但是警察会处理的
Okay? What happened to Armand is terrible, but the police will handle it.

657
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,790
我不想你再去掺合了
I don't want you doing any more snooping.

658
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:12,000
你会受伤的 我说的可不是 膝盖擦伤那么简单 凯特
You could get really hurt, and we're not talking scrapes on the knee anymore, Kate.

659
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,870
妈妈 还有别的呢 有忍者服 还有街头黑帮
Mom, there was more. There was a ninja suit and a street gang.

660
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,950
-燃烧的酒瓶 -街头黑帮 
-Molotov cocktails... -Street gang?

661
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,330
忍者 燃烧的酒瓶又是怎么回事 
Ninjas? What exactly is in a Molotov cocktail, anyway?

662
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,250
你到喝酒的年龄了吗 
Are you... Are you old enough to drink?

663
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,910
凯特 一切都会没事的
- -Kate, everything will be okay.

664
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,410
我会因为生活的不确定性感到害怕
Okay, I get being scared at the uncertainty of what comes next in life,

665
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,370
但是你的生活可没什么不确定的
but we know what comes next for you.

666
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,540
你会毕业 秋天的时候 你就会开始在毕肖普安保公司工作
You'll graduate, and in the fall, you'll start working at Bishop Security.

667
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,870
-像我们计划的一样 -像你计划的一样
-Like we've always planned. -Like you've always planned.

668
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:48,290
凯特 脚踏实地一步一步来
Kate, just put one foot in front of the other,

669
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,790
几年以后 你会满意的 我保证
and in a few years, you'll look up, and I promise,

670
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,450
你会对你的生活满意的 我保证
you will be happy where you are. I promise.

671
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,120
好吗 能不能把这些事情都忘掉 
Okay? Can we just put all this behind us?

672
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,330
亲爱的 好吗 你要不要
Hon? Okay? Why don't you start

673
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,700
先和杰克道个歉 
by apologizing to Jack?

674
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,500
抱歉逼你说实话
Sorry for scaring you into telling the truth.

675
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,910
这姑娘可真是伶牙俐齿啊
Smart as a whip, this one, huh?

676
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,950
要不要喝一杯 亲爱的 
Would you like a drink, darling?

677
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,330
-你没事吧  -我没事
-Are you okay? -I'm fine, I'm fine.

678
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,700
这也不是第一次有人想要我的命了
It's not the first time somebody tried to take my head off.

679
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,450
吃块糖 
Butterscotch?

680
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,620
凯特 怎么了 
Kate. What's wrong?

681
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,830
